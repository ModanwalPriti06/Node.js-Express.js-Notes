# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- CORS errors occur when a web application running on one domain (origin) tries to fetch resources (API, fonts, scripts) from another domain without proper permissions.
### Solutions to Prevent CORS Issues
1. Enable CORS on the Server (Best Approach)
2. Modify Headers in the Backend
3. Use a Proxy (Frontend Side Fix)
4. Enable CORS in Browser (Temporary Fix for Testing)

### Best Practice
- ‚úÖ Modify the backend to send proper CORS headers (recommended).
- ‚úÖ Use a proxy if backend changes are not possible.
- ‚úÖ Do not disable CORS security in production.

# What is NodeJs?

- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript outside the browser, mainly on servers.
- NodeJs use V8 and V8 is JS engine build by google that run javascript in browser.
- Engine mean: Engine take js code and node use and its compile js code in machine code.
- V8 written in C++ language
- ‚úÖ Built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 engine ‚Äì Fast execution of JavaScript.
- ‚úÖ Single-threaded, event-driven, and non-blocking ‚Äì Handles multiple requests efficiently.
- ‚úÖ Uses an asynchronous I/O model ‚Äì Perfect for real-time applications like chat apps, APIs, and streaming services.

###  Why Use Node.js?
-  Scalable & lightweight ‚Äì Ideal for microservices and APIs.
-  Fast performance ‚Äì Uses the V8 engine for high-speed execution.
-  Non-blocking I/O ‚Äì Handles thousands of concurrent connections.
-  Full-stack JavaScript ‚Äì Use JavaScript on both frontend & backend.

### difference between Browser and Nodejs run time environment:
- Browser can access DOM operation but nodejs can't.
- Runs JavaScript in the browser for frontend applications. Nodejs Runs JavaScript on the server for backend applications.
- Browser : DOM, BOM, Web APIs (e.g., document, window, fetch). Nodejs: Built-in Module (http, os fs etc)
- BrowserL ‚ùå No direct access to files. Nodejs: ‚úÖ Full access using the fs module.

### Window Vs Global Object
- The javascript global object for the browser is window and for the nodejs is global
- The window object contain the method and property available only inthe browser environment.

# Node.js Architecture (Single-threaded, Event Loop, Non-blocking I/O)

## Event loop
- The event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations. JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes code sequentially in a single call stack.
- Everything in Javascript happened in execution context.
```
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log("setImmediate"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick"));
console.log("End");   
```
output:
```
Start
nextTick
setImmediate
setTimeout
End
```
### process.nextTick() in Node.js
- process.nextTick() is a Node.js method that schedules a callback function to be executed immediately after the current operation completes, before the Event Loop continues to the next phase.
- process.nextTick() executes after the synchronous code, but before the Event Loop moves to the next phase.

### execution context
- A big box which divide in 2 category
1. Memory Component ( Variable environment) = all variable and function are store in key value pair.
2. Code Component (Thread of Execution) = Just like whole code executed in thread run **one line at the time** (means one time can run one line only) that's why js is synchronous single threaded code component. 

### How it works:
<img width="400" height="600" alt="node js 2025-03-21 at 4 13 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4777e64-6aee-41be-adab-688ba2b67a5f"/>

- Call Stack: JavaScript executes synchronous code line by line, pushing and popping function calls from the stack. Every time bottom of the stack have Execution context, means whenever js program is run this callstack populate this global execution context (GEC).
- Call stack maintain the order of execution of execution context.
- Web APIs: Asynchronous tasks like setTimeout, fetch, or event listeners are handled by Web APIs.
- Callback Queue & Microtask Queue: Once asynchronous tasks are completed, their callbacks are placed in the queue.
-  Microtasks (Promises, process.nextTick in Node.js) are prioritized over macrotasks (setTimeout, setInterval).
-  Event Loop: It constantly checks if the call stack is empty and pushes queued callbacks for execution.

## Single-threaded
- A single-threaded system means that it uses only one thread to execute tasks at a time. A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a process, and in a single-threaded model, tasks are executed sequentially on a single main thread.

# Module in Node JS
- Module - When divide code small-2 part that is called modular coding.
- A module in Node.js is a reusable block of code (functions, objects, variables, etc.) that can be exported from one file and imported into another.
- Clean and maintainable code
- Reusability
- Easy debugging and testing
  
# Types of Modules in Node.js : Built-in , Local, Third-Party

| **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | 
| ------------ | ---------------| ------------ |
| Built-in Modules|	Pre-installed Node.js modules. |	fs, http, path, crypto, os, url |
| Local Modules/ User-defined Modules | Custom modules created in the project.	| require("./myModule") |
| Third-party Modules |	Installed using npm. | express, mongoose, cors , lodash |

# Difference Between CommonJS (require()) and ESM (import)

| **Feature** | **CommonJS (require)** | **ES Modules (import)** | 
| ------------ | ---------------| ------------ |
|  Default in Node.js | 	‚úÖ Yes	| ‚ùå No (Needs "type": "module")| 
| Execution| 	Synchronous| 	Asynchronous| 
| Can Load Dynamically?| 	‚ùå No| 	‚úÖ Yes (Using import())| 
| Usage	| Used in older projects	| Recommended for modern projects| 

# Dynamic Module Import (Lazy Loading)
- ES Modules allow lazy loading using import().

#### Summary of Module above:
- ‚úî Built-in Modules ‚Üí Use require("module").
- ‚úî Custom Modules ‚Üí Use require("./file") (CommonJS) or import (ESM).
- ‚úî Third-Party Modules ‚Üí Install via npm install module-name.
- ‚úî Use import() for lazy loading in ES Modules.

# Non-Blocking I/O Vs Blocking I/O:
- Non-blocking means working with multiple request without blocking the thread for a single request.
  - Faster & efficient ‚Äì Uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle responses later.
- Blocking - Executes synchronously: The process waits until an I/O operation (file read, DB query) completes.
   - Slower performance ‚Äì One operation blocks others until it finishes.

# Concept of Libuv
- Libuv is an open-source libarary built-in C, It has a strong focus on asynchronous and I/O. This give node access tothe underlying computer OS, filesystem and networking.
- ode.js uses libuv to manage a thread pool for handling heavy tasks like file system operations, cryptography, and networking.
- Libuv implement two extrenely important feature of node.js
  - Event Loop
  - Thread Pool

# How Node JS Work 
<img width="400" height="600" alt="node js 2025-03-21 at 4 13 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcd6160a-29d6-4a8a-b8e8-0fb522923bd5" />

## Thread Pool 
- A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized worker threads that can be reused to perform multiple tasks instead of creating new threads every time.
- The default thread pool size in Node.js is 4 (configurable via UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE).
- We can change thread pool size - process.ev.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 7 (based on CPU core);
  
### How it Works?
- A task is assigned to the thread pool.
- An available thread picks up the task and executes it.
- Once the task is complete, the thread is returned to the pool for reuse.
  
# Pooling
<img width="400" height="600" alt="node js 2025-03-21 at 4 13 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/617ae81a-f668-460b-a4c7-737d35542840" />

- Short Pooling: In the short pooling when client req server then server wait for res for some time and then return response either data or empty payload.
- Long Pooling: In Long pooling when client req to server then server return res only when data is there if data is not there then your req is open untill you are not getting response. After response he will again req and open that one for next response.
- **Example** can say - Group of channel in whatsapp when One user change dp u also get notification from server that time you are not req but still got response. 
- Web shocket: Bi-directional relationship b/w the client and server. When Client req then server response (Whatsapp Chat)

## Proxy
- A proxy acts as an intermediary between a client and a server.
- In Networking: A proxy server is a system or router that acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It‚Äôs used for:
  - Hiding your IP address
  - Improving security
  - Controlling internet usage (like in schools or offices).
  - Caching frequently accessed websites for speed.

- An isolated client uses a forward proxy.

#  Working with File System (fs module)
- The fs module in Node.js allows you to interact with the file system ‚Äî like reading, writing, updating, deleting files and directories.
- Read File
  ```
  const fs = require('fs');
  fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
  });
  ```
- Write File
```
  fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'Hello, World!', (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File written');
  });
```
- Append File
```
  fs.appendFile('file.txt', '\nNew Line', (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
```
-  Delete File
```
  fs.unlink('file.txt', (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File deleted');
  });
```
- Create Folder
```
fs.mkdir('newFolder', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
});
```
- Check if File Exists
```
 fs.existsSync('file.txt'); // returns true or false
```
#### üß† Bonus: 
- Use fs.promises for promise-based operations (with async/await)
- Use path module to handle file paths safely
  
# Buffer and Stream
- A Buffer is a temporary storage in memory used to hold binary data (like files, images, videos, etc.) when you‚Äôre dealing with raw data.
- A Stream is a sequence of data chunks being transferred over time (bit-by-bit), rather than loading everything into memory at once.
## Why Streams?
- Efficient: Don‚Äôt need to load entire file into memory.
- Great for large files: e.g., video streaming, file downloads/uploads.

## 4 Types of Streams:
1. Readable ‚Äì e.g., fs.createReadStream()
2. Writable ‚Äì e.g., fs.createWriteStream()
3. Duplex ‚Äì both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets)
4. Transform ‚Äì a special duplex stream for modifying data (e.g., gzip)
```
 reader.pipe(writer); // sends data chunk by chunk
```

## üí° In Real Life:
- Buffer is like downloading the whole movie before watching.
- Stream is like watching a movie while it's still downloading.
